# UAVDT-Object-Detection-Training-
UAVDT Object Detection Training  
Project Overview  
This project applies object-detection techniques on the UAVDT dataset — aiming to detect vehicles in aerial/drone imagery (cars, trucks, buses, etc.). The main goal is to train and evaluate a deep learning model to locate and classify these vehicle objects in challenging UAV video-frames.

Dataset  
Source: UAVDT (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Benchmark: Object Detection and Tracking) — a large scale benchmark for object detection & tracking in UAV videos. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
Dataset is not included in this repository (due to size/licensing).  
Format: Video frames/images (UAV view) + bounding box annotations + metadata (vehicle category, occlusion, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
Notes:  
  - The dataset covers many scenes (urban areas, highways, toll stations) recorded with UAVs. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
  - There may be issues like small object scale, camera motion, occlusion, changing illumination — you should mention these.  
- Instructions: Download the dataset directly from the official source or Kaggle dataset page and place it in the `data/` folder (or your chosen directory).

Notebook / Code  
- Your notebook (`uavdt_object_detection.ipynb` or similar) contains:  
  1. Data loading & preprocessing (frames extraction, annotation parsing)  
  2. Preparing training / validation splits and dataset loaders  
  3. Model architecture selection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD)  
  4. Training loop, monitoring losses, saving checkpoints  
  5. Evaluation of model: metrics like mAP, precision, recall (for detection)  
  6. Visualisation: sample detections on frames with bounding boxes  
- Make sure your notebook is well-documented: code cells + markdown describing your choices (hyperparameters, architecture, training epochs, data augmentation, challenges etc).
